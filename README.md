# EV-HACKATHON-2.0
Project Overview:
For the EV Hackathon 2.0 competition, my team and I developed a cutting-edge project that aimed to address a significant challenge in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Our project focused on design eletric vehicle based powertrain in matlabfor existing 2W or 4W

Target:

Design and Simulation of Electric VehicleÂ 

Vehicle segment: 3-wheeler

Model: Euler Hiload PV

To increase the existing load capacity by 50% and add a hub motor to compensate it.

Replacing 3 phase induction motor with brushless dc motor.

To incorporate two batteries types instead of one.

Technologies Utilized:
Our project leveraged a combination of cutting-edge technologies to achieve its goals:

Technology 1: JMAG - used for design the motors

Technology 2: Matlab/Simulink - use to design powertrain and analysis the performance
Outcome and Achievements:
Through meticulous planning, tireless development, and a dedicated team effort, our project secured a place among the finalists in the highly competitive EV Hackathon 2.0. This recognition validates our commitment to innovation and problem-solving in the EV domain.

Moreover, our accomplishment didn't stop at the competition. Our project's performance and potential caught the attention of industry experts and stakeholders. As a result, we were offered an internship opportunity with Bosch Global Software Techonologies, a prominent player in the EV industry. This internship is a testament to the real-world applicability and value of our project's concepts.

Future Prospects:
With the internship on the horizon, our team is excited about the opportunities it will bring. We look forward to further refining our project, potentially bringing it closer to commercialization, and contributing meaningfully to the advancement of electric vehicle technology.

In conclusion, our project's journey from the EV Hackathon 2.0 competition to becoming a finalist and securing an internship demonstrates our dedication to innovation, problem-solving, and making a tangible impact in the EV sector. We are grateful for the recognition and eager to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of electric vehicles.
